## /not_and_or

From Codecademy python tutorial:

```
This and That (or This, But Not That!)
Boolean operators aren't just evaluated from left to right. Just like with arithmetic operators, there's an order of operations for boolean operators:

not is evaluated first;
and is evaluated next;
or is evaluated last.
For example, True or not False and False returns True. If this isn't clear, look at the Hint.

Parentheses () ensure your expressions are evaluated in the order you want. Anything in parentheses is evaluated as its own unit.

EXAMPLES:

bool_one = False or not True and True

bool_two = False and not True or True

bool_three = True and not (False or False)

bool_four = not not True or False and not True

bool_five = False or not (True and True)

```
